so some people go about life denying it 
other people blame everyone except themselves 
like my friend who says he is not ever going to give up his suv until they stop building coal plants in china 
but we have an opportunity to change 
no two of us are the same every single one of us has the opportunity to change our attitudes our own and those of people around us
so today U want to invite all of you to join me in helping to spark an open and honest conversation with the people around you about the gray rhinos in our world and be brutally honest about how well we are dealing with them 
I hear so many times in the states well of course we should deal with obvious problems but if you don not see what is in front of you
you are either dumb or ignorant 
that is what they say and I could not disagree more 
if you don not see what is in front of you you are not dumb you are not ignorant you are a human
